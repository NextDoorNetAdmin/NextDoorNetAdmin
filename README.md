ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m the @NextDoorNetAdmin!

I run a YouTube channel where I talk about the life, tasks, and challenges of your everyday network administrator. Sometimes, I go pretty deep into a technical topic, and this is how I make sure everybody can see what I'm doing (and can follow along or recreate my work, if they'd like).

Feel free to stop by and join the conversation on YouTube, or just make use of what you find here!
